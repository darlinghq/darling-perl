=head1 NAME

Mail::DKIM::DNS - performs DNS queries for Mail::DKIM

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the module that performs DNS queries for L<Mail::DKIM>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

This module has a couple configuration settings that the caller
may want to use to customize the behavior of this module.

=head2 $Mail::DKIM::DNS::TIMEOUT

This global variable specifies the maximum amount of time (in seconds)
to wait for a single DNS query to complete. The default is 10.

=head2 Mail::DKIM::DNS::resolver()

Use this global subroutine to get or replace the instance of
L<Net::DNS::Resolver> that Mail::DKIM uses. If set to undef (the default),
then a brand new default instance of L<Net::DNS::Resolver> will be
created the first time a DNS query is needed.

You will call this subroutine if you want to specify non-default options
to L<Net::DNS::Resolver>, such as different timeouts, or to enable use
of a persistent socket. For example:

  # first, construct a custom DNS resolver
  my $res = Net::DNS::Resolver->new(
                    udp_timeout => 3, tcp_timeout => 3, retry => 2,
                 );
  $res->udppacketsize(1240);
  $res->persistent_udp(1);

  # then, tell Mail::DKIM to use this resolver
  Mail::DKIM::DNS::resolver($res);

=head2 Mail::DKIM::DNS::enable_EDNS0()

This is a convenience subroutine that will construct an appropriate DNS
resolver that uses EDNS0 (Extension mechanisms for DNS) to support large
DNS replies, and configure Mail::DKIM to use it. (As such, it should NOT
be used in conjunction with the resolver() subroutine described above.)

  Mail::DKIM::DNS::enable_EDNS0();

Use of EDNS0 is recommended, since it reduces the need for falling back to TCP
when dealing with large DNS packets. However, it is not enabled by default
because some Internet firewalls which do deep inspection of packets are not able
to process EDNS0-enabled packets. When there is a firewall on a path to a DNS
resolver, the EDNS0 feature should be specifically tested before enabling.
