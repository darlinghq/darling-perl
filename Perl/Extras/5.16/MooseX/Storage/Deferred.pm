=head1 NAME

MooseX::Storage::Deferred - A role for undecisive programmers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Point;
  use Moose;
  use MooseX::Storage;

  our $VERSION = '0.01';

  with 'MooseX::Storage::Deferred';

  has 'x' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Int');
  has 'y' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Int');

  1;

  my $p = Point->new(x => 10, y => 10);

  ## methods to freeze/thaw into
  ## a specified serialization format
  ## (in this case JSON)

  # pack the class into a JSON string
  $p->freeze({ format => 'JSON' }); # { "__CLASS__" : "Point", "x" : 10, "y" : 10 }

  # pack the class into a JSON string using parameterized JSONpm role
  $p->freeze({ format => [ JSONpm => { json_opts => { pretty => 1 } } ] });

  # unpack the JSON string into a class
  my $p2 = Point->thaw(
      '{ "__CLASS__" : "Point", "x" : 10, "y" : 10 }',
      { format => 'JSON' }
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role is designed for those times when you need to
serialize into many different formats or I/O options.

It basically allows you to choose the format and IO
options only when you actually use them (see the
SYNOPSIS for more info)

=head1 SUPPORTED FORMATS

=over 4

=item I<JSON>

=item I<JSONpm>

=item I<YAML>

=item I<Storable>

=back

=head1 SUPPORTED I/O

=over 4

=item I<File>

=item I<AtomicFile>

=back

B<NOTE:> The B<StorableFile> I/O option is not supported,
this is because it does not mix well with options who also
have a C<thaw> and C<freeze> methods like this. It is possible
to probably work around this issue, but I don't currently
have the need for it. If you need this supported, talk to me
and I will see what I can do.
